Join us for a full day of civic technology talks, and projects.

 

**Featured projects.**

1\. **Crow Creek water quality testing**. codesy sponsorship. [savecrowcreek.org](http://savecrowcreek.org/) ([Github](https://github.com/Yahyaal/SaveCrowCreek)) We have once again invited Blue Thumb OK to work with us. At CodeAcross this past Feb., we took a field trip with Cheryl Cheadle to Crow Creek, and learned how to test the creek's water for pollutants (fertilizers, pesticides, etc). Now we'll be taking those tools and creating a web app that any citizen with a water testing kit, can use to report their findings online.

2\. T**ulsa Health Dept. Inspections**. collaboration w/ legal aid & the tulsa county health department. THD inspects homes to ensure and enforce certain minimum building standards that must be in place if the structure is occupied or used. These standards include requirements pertaining to sanitation, maintenance, electrical, mechanical and plumbing systems, and more. Currently home inspection forms and results, are not in a digital format. This project aims to give [Tulsa County Health Dept.](http://www.tulsa-health.org/) inspectors a digital form by which to report their findings, and ultimately a way for the collected data to be shared with local health providers. **Local Projects.**
