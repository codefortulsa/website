#### We provide the space, wifi, food, and some easy starter projects. You just have to show up with a computer and a desire to help Tulsa! Come for an hour or the whole weekend.

**Fly Loft** 117 N Boston Ave., Tulsa, OK ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/OBAw1), [street view](https://www.google.com/maps/@36.158306,-95.992279,3a,75y,36.81h,79.56t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s3g3Pza8siNXmaaPkF1eqdQ!2e0!6m1!1e1)) \[googlemaps https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1424473139020!6m8!1m7!1s3g3Pza8siNXmaaPkF1eqdQ!2m2!1d36.158306!2d-95.992279!3f36.81!4f-10.439999999999998!5f0.7820865974627469&w=400&h=300\]

### CodeAcross Challenges:

- [US City Open Data Census](http://us-city.census.okfn.org/): Survey the quality and usability of the 10 most-searched for digital services in your city. Measure access to open data in Tulsa and compare to other cities.
- [Local Digital Services Census](https://service-census.herokuapp.com/): Survey the quality and usability of the 10 most-searched for digital services in Tulsa.
- [Health Focus Area + mRelief Challenge](https://github.com/mRelief/mrelief_snap_screeners): Help understand the ways in which different states screen food stamp eligibility.
- [Civic Tech Issue Finder](http://www.codeforamerica.org/geeks/civicissues): Code for America right now by working on open GitHub issues from across the network.

### Code for Tulsa Projects:

**1\. Civic Ninja's Citizen Power Brigade** The project idea is to enlist owners of hybrid vehicles to create mobile charging stations when a natural disaster has caused widespread power outages.  Learn more at the [Civic Ninjas](http://civicninjas.org/citizen-power-brigade/) website.

**2\. Balance + EBTAround.Me** We'll be discussing ways to improve the delivery of SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) services, throughout the city and state.  Using [previous local research](http://captulsa.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Better-Benefits-Vol.-4.pdf), leveraging two Code for Tulsa projects already near completion, and working collaboratively with other local nonprofit agencies, we hope to help those who are receiving food stamp benefits.

**3\. Healthy Food Survey** We'll be working with [OSU CNEP](http://fcs.okstate.edu/cnep/) to write up a user research [interview script](http://www.productpsychology.com/lesson-9-how-to-do-effective-user-research/) based on [Fogg Behavior Model](http://www.bjfogg.com/fbm_files/page4_1.pdf) to conduct at [Good Samaritan Health Service](http://www.goodsamaritanhealth.org/) clinic sites over the weekend. We will report what we learn about their patients' motivation and ability to eat healthy nutritious foods.

It's happening in about 50 cities, all over the world in places like Curitiba, Brazil; Melbourne, Australia; San Francisco, California; Zagreb, Croatia and...**Tulsa**!

The weekend of February 20-22, 2015, [Code for America](http://www.codeforamerica.org/) will hold its fourth annual [CodeAcross](http://www.codeforamerica.org/events/codeacross-2015/) event. CodeAcross is a weekend of civic hacking events hosted by nodes of the Code for America network around the world. The goal of CodeAcross is to activate the Code for America network and inspire residents everywhere to get actively involved in their community.

Here in Tulsa, we're once again partnering with the [Association for Computing Machinery](http://orgs.utulsa.edu/acm/) (ACM) student chapter at TU  and we've got some exciting projects and activities for coders and non-coders alike.

 

We're looking forward to seeing you there!
