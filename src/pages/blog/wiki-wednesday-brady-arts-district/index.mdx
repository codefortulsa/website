First things first! National Day of Civic Hacking is this Saturday, June 1!

[![Eventbrite - National Day of Civic Hacking - Tulsa](http://www.eventbrite.com/custombutton?eid=5860692489)](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/5860692489?ref=ebtnebregn)

Now, on to Wiki Wednesday!

Wednesdays are special. Wiki Wednesday, Food Truck Wednesday at Guthrie Green...You have plenty of enjoyable ways to make it through the middle of the week!

As you make your way through Brady this week for food trucks, art, music, or the many other diversions there, take some pictures and compose some content, because our theme this week is the [Brady Arts District](http://tulsawiki.org/tags/bradyartsdistrict "Brady Arts District tags"). Think about your favorite haunts in the area where you have in-depth knowledge, and then share it on the TulsaWiki.

If you think "I don't get over to the Brady Arts District much, so I can't think of anything to write," then it's time you visit! This historic neighborhood has enjoyed tremendous revitalization over the past several years. [Guthrie Green](http://tulsawiki.org/Guthrie_Green "Guthrie Green") offers an urban green space, a performance area, a [splash pad](http://tulsawiki.org/tags/splashpad "Splash Pad tags"), Lucky's on the Green, and many free events. [First Friday Art Crawl](http://tulsawiki.org/search/?q=First+Friday+Art+Crawl "First Friday Art Crawl") (if you're first, you can create that page on the wiki!) is a great chance to check out the many galleries in the area (and if you go to the June 7 art crawl, yes, you can still add your wiki articles).

But, enough blog post--it's your turn to write!
