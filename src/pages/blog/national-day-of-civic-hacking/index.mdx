Today is the day!

For easy reference, I'm including a [link to our hackpad](https://hackforchange.hackpad.com/NATIONAL-DAY-OF-CIVIC-HACKING-TULSA-K74m34nBg5H) - Please use this to capture ideas for future projects and questions you have, and to get to know one another better. There are also some project descriptions if you want to work on something besides the [TulsaWiki.](http://www.tulsawiki.org/) You can log in with Google Account or create a new free account.
