Imagine a world in which, neighborhood by neighborhood, people stop putting password locks on their Wi-Fi networks and instead share their Internet connections with their neighbors, giving everyone in their community access to a fast and open Internet.­­

This is the vision of the [Open Wireless Movement](https://openwireless.org/ "Open Wireless Movement"), a group that aims to grassroots wireless infrastructure through individuals and organizations sharing their internet connections freely. The website contains an FAQ, which tries to respond to "myths" about providing open wireless access, and discusses open wireless benefits and some information about how to provide free wireless service without compromising network speed and security.

Tulsa has joined this movement, and the website [http://tulsaopenwireless.org/](http://tulsaopenwireless.org/ "Tulsa Open Wireless") was launched at the end of January to encourage individuals, businesses, and other organizations to collect information about open wireless networks (via [MozStumbler](https://location.services.mozilla.com/ "MozStumbler"), an Android app for building a free database of geolocation based on network availability (...this is more [fun](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/mozilla-location-services-makes-geolocation-data-public-and-gamifies-collection/ "gamification of collecting public wifi information") than it sounds)) as well as provide open wireless access.

The Open Wireless website lists many [benefits](https://openwireless.org/reasons "benefits of open wifi") to ubiquitous, free, wifi. The following sums several of them up quite nicely: "A world where people always have their online services and social networking tools at hand is a world where both businesses and municipalities can better lure people out from behind their desks."
