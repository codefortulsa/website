FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Tulsa Selected for Code for America Brigade -- Volunteer Group to Open Data and Build Web Tools for Community

Local Tulsa group is part of a national network of 30+ community groups collaborating with local governments to use technology to solve problems.

Tulsa, OK, September 17, 2013 — Today, a local group of community-minded technologists, planners, and designers announced it will join the Code for America Brigade -- starting Tulsa’s local chapter.

Code for America seeks to foster and facilitate innovation in government. Through Brigades it helps to organize and support civic hackers locally to use technology to enhance their community.

“Quote from municipal partner”

This local Brigade, [Code for Tulsa](http://codefortulsa.org) (http://codefortulsa.org), will collaborate with Tulsa government to draft IT policies, open city data in standard formats, and build web and mobile apps for citizens.

Code for Tulsa, headed up by Luke Crouch and John Whitlock, will participate in the Brigade’s leadership program, which includes monthly trainings, participation in a network of civic and tech leaders, and support from Code for America staff.

Crouch elaborates, “The Code for America Brigade program supports grassroots groups like ours to put the power and value of technology in citizens' hands. So together - government, developers, and citizens can solve community problems in innovative ways that aren't always possible to government alone.”

Code for America launched the Brigade program in 2012 enacting 16 local chapters. This year 15 new Brigades will be added to the program.

While the private sector has experienced rapid innovation over the past decade, adopting new technologies that change the way people access information and services, local governments haven’t adapted at the same rate. Code for America Brigades partner with local governments to foster civic innovation. Developers and designers collaborate with municipal leaders to create and implement web applications, and explore new approaches to local challenges.
