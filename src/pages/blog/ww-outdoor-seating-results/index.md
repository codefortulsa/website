The results are in from our first [Wiki Wednesday](http://codefortulsa.org/2013/03/27/wiki-wednesday-lets-eat-outside/ "Wiki Wednesday – Let’s Eat Outside!").  The [Outdoor Seating](http://www.tulsawiki.org/tags/outdoorseating "Outdoor Seating tagged pages on Tulsa Wiki") tag now includes pages for [Elote](http://www.tulsawiki.org/Elote_Cafe_%26_Catering "Elote's page on the Tulsa Wiki"), [Elwood's](http://www.tulsawiki.org/Elwood%27s "Elwood's page on the Tulsa Wiki"), [El Guapo's](http://www.tulsawiki.org/El_Guapo%27s_Cantina "El Guapo's page on the Tulsa Wiki"), and the [Boulder Grill](http://www.tulsawiki.org/Boulder_Grill "Boulder Grill's page on the Tulsa Wiki").  We also have new pages for [Chimera](http://www.tulsawiki.org/Chimera "Chimera's page on the Tulsa Wiki") and the [Fab Lab](http://www.tulsawiki.org/Fab_Lab_Tulsa "Fab Lab's page on the Tulsa Wiki").

TulsaWiki is a young wiki, in an awkward stage.  There is so much that _could_ be on the wiki, that it can be hard to know where to start.  It takes a certain bravery and boldness to dive in and create a page.  That's why I'm especially happy that we got at least 3 new editors.  Welcome [adossett](http://www.tulsawiki.org/Users/adossett "adossett's user page on the Tulsa Wiki"), [destos](http://www.tulsawiki.org/Users/destos "destos's user page on the Tulsa Wiki"), and [soulpropRioter](http://www.tulsawiki.org/Users/soulpropRioter "soulpropRioter's user page on the TulsaWiki")!

Please continue adding restaurants, whether they have patios or not.  But also, follow your passion.  What is important to you in your town?  If time is limited, make a placeholder page.  When you come back, you may be surprised to see that others have filled in the details.

We'll do another Wiki Wednesday, and continue doing them until the [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://www.tulsawiki.org/National_Day_of_Civic_Hacking_2013 "Nation Day of Civic Hacking 2013 on the Tulsa Wiki").  If you can think of a WW topic that excites you, add it in the comments, or better yet, add it to [Pages Wanted](http://www.tulsawiki.org/Pages_Wanted "Pages Wanted") on the Tulsa Wiki.
