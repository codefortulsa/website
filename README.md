Code For Tulsa, an official brigade of Code For America, hosts a website and blog at [codefortulsa.org](https://codefortulsa.org).  This is that website's working repository.

The Code for Tulsa website aims to be a beacon for engagement in civic tech volunteer opportunities within the greater Tulsa area.

*The site is currently undergoing a major update. See below for more information*

## Background
  This repo started as an effort to modernize the core site and create a dynamic working environment that facilitates additional contributions from current and future volunteers of all backgrounds.

 In the early stages of this redesign project, the requirements were simple: create a web blog that facilitates content contributions from non-technical volunteers. Because of this, the project was initially bootstrapped as a static Gatsby site.

 Soon after, discussions began about integrating other resources utilized by the organization, such as Twitter, Slack, Meetup, etc. It was agreed that a more flexible framework was desired to keep up with the dynamic demands of the organization and provide broader variety for volunteer engagement. The project was migrated to Next.Js in January 2022 and adapted for deployment on serverless platforms.

 While the infrastructure now exists for more complex features, every effort should be made to implement them in as low resource/cost-effective a manner as possible by using static or incremental generation, external APIs, and client-side offloading wherever possible.

## Installation

### Pre-Requisites
Install the LTS version of Node:
```sh
# via nvm (recommended) https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

# via pre-built installer
https://nodejs.dev/download/
```
Install Yarn:
```sh
npm install --global yarn
```
### Local Development

Clone the repo and cd into the directory:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/codefortulsa/website.git ./code-for-tulsa-website
cd ./code-for-tulsa-website
```

#### With Docker
[Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

Build the image:
```sh
docker build -t codefortulsa/website .
```
Run the app with composer
```sh
docker-compose up
```
- add `-d` flag to run container(s) in the background. 
- if running in the background, you can start the logs up with `docker-compose logs -f`
(the `-f` will keep the logs running, omit it for a one time print)

#### Without Docker
Install packages & start the dev server:
```sh
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Run e2e and component tests with Cypress locally:
- Launch app:
```sh
yarn build
yarn start
OR
yarn dev
```
- In separate process:
run headless in terminal:
```sh
yarn test
```
run with cypress ui:
```sh
yarn cypress:ui
```

Component tests go in the `cypress/component` directory

End to End tests go in the `cypress/e2e` directory
